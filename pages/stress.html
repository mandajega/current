                font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Pregnancy often brings 
                a rollercoaster of emotions due to hormonal shifts. Experiencing stress
                 is normal, but extended periods can harm both you and your baby, 
                 causing issues like depression or high blood pressure. Prioritize 
                 mental wellness alongside physical health. Open communication with 
                 loved ones, mindfulness, or prenatal yoga can help. Seek assistance from 
                 your midwife or GP if needed. About 78% of pregnant women face low to moderate 
                 stress, with 6% experiencing high levels. Reducing stress is crucial, linked 
                 to better outcomes for both mother and baby.</p>  <br>

                                  Stress happens when we face challenges or situations that make us 
                                  feel pressure. This could be because of things like work deadlines, 
                                  tough choices, or health worries. Even good things happening in our 
                                  lives, like exciting events, can also lead to stress.<br><br>
                                  A bit of stress is normal and can actually help us focus and get 
                                  things done. It's like a little push that keeps us motivated.<br><br>
                                  However, when there's too much stress, it can become hard to handle 
                                  daily tasks. Too much stress can affect our bodies, thoughts, and 
                                  feelings. It can even change how we act. For instance, some people 
                                  might eat too much or get really mad when they're super stressed.

                              Sometimes it's hard to tell when you're stressed. It might sneak up on you 
                              and become a big problem before you even realize it.<br><br>
                              It's easier to handle stress if you know what things in your life might 
                              be causing it, and if you can recognize the signs that you're feeling 
                              stressed.<br><br>

                                can be stressful. The physical and emotional changes of pregnancy can also be overwhelming,

                                        If multiple stressors happen at the same time, like dealing with

                            <b> How Stress Affects Pregnancy: </b> <br><br>
                            When someone is pregnant, stress can happen for various reasons. Sometimes 
                            it's about the pregnancy itself, like if there are health issues. Other times, 
                            stress comes from things unrelated to pregnancy, like money problems, work, taking 
                            care of other kids, or problems in relationships. Pregnancy causes hormonal changes 
                            that can make feelings of stress, anxiety, and sadness stronger. <br><br>
                            <b> Effects of High Stress During Pregnancy: </b> <br><br> 
                            Too much stress during pregnancy can cause problems for both the mother and the 
                            baby. Moms under a lot of stress have a higher chance of having a miscarriage or 
                            a condition called pre-eclampsia, which is dangerous because it involves high blood 
                            pressure. Stress can also lead to the mother feeling depressed or anxious.
                            <br><br>
                            Feeling this way during pregnancy is concerning because it makes the risk of 
                            postpartum depression higher, which is a type of depression that happens after 
                            giving birth. Moms who are stressed during pregnancy might have a tougher time 
                            enjoying being pregnant and might have more difficulties.

                                Taking care of stress is beneficial for both your well-being and your baby's health 
                                during and after pregnancy. By handling stress well, you can lower the risk of giving 
                                birth too early and decrease the chances of your baby having health issues like asthma 
                                and allergies when they grow up. <br><br>
                                Moreover, managing stress can make your whole pregnancy journey more positive. When 
                                you have a good handle on stress and know how to manage it, you'll likely find it easier 
                                to deal with new challenges that come up after your baby is born.

                                   When you're pregnant, you might feel lots of different emotions because of the 
                                   hormones in your body. Stress is a common feeling for many expectant mothers. 
                                   It's okay to feel this way sometimes, but if you're very stressed for a long time, 
                                   it's not good for you or your baby. Too much stress can make you feel worse and 
                                   cause problems like depression, weight issues, or high blood pressure.
                                    <br><br>Here are some things you can do to feel less stressed during pregnancy:

                              Pregnant women can feel stressed, but it affects everyone differently. 
                              Sometimes stress can make your body feel uncomfortable, like having headaches 
                              or tummy aches. Other times, stress can make you feel upset or worried. Stress 
                              isn't a sickness, but if it sticks around and makes your life hard, it might 
                              lead to feeling very anxious.<br><br>

                              Stress can affect both you and your baby during pregnancy. Chronic stress,

                                            it could also cause issues for your baby. These problems might involve how 
                                            your baby grows inside you and how long your pregnancy lasts. It might even 
                                            increase the chances of your baby having problems with their body and mind as 
                                            they grow up. <br><br> 
                                            If you're only stressed sometimes, it's not likely to harm your baby. But if you're 
                                            feeling stressed all the time and struggling to handle it, talk to your midwife or doctor. 
                                            Being extremely stressed for a long time could raise the risk of having your baby too early 
                                            or with a low birth weight. <br><br> 
                                            Too much stress during pregnancy can even affect the baby's brain. It's linked 
                                            to things like having a small baby or giving birth too soon. These problems can 
                                            lead to health issues for the baby, even later in their life. <br><br> 
                                            Babies exposed to stress when still in the tummy might also have more health 
                                            problems when they're born. Pregnant women who are very stressed are more likely 
                                            to smoke, drink a lot of caffeine, and eat unhealthy foods, which can be bad for 
                                            the baby. <br><br> 
                                            In short, managing stress during pregnancy is important for both you 
                                            and your baby's health.

                               be a psychologist, counselor, or therapist. They'll listen to you and show you 
                               better ways to handle your feelings. You can do this alone or with a group. 
                               There are different types of talking therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy 
                               (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). <br><br>
                               Sometimes, doctors might also suggest medicine. But they'll be careful 
                               because not all medicines are safe during pregnancy. They'll talk to you 
                               about the good and not-so-good things about the medicine, and help you decide 
                               what's best for you and your baby. If you're already taking medicine for your 
                               feelings, don't stop suddenly. Talk to your doctor about what's safe. <br><br>
                               Even if you think your stress isn't really bad, it's okay to talk to 
                               your midwife. They can help you find ways to feel better. Remember, asking 
                               for help is a strong thing to do, and there are people who want to support you.
